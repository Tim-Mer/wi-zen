Maybe to be code to run a zen garden on a rasbperry pi pico 2 w



## ideas

### Display options

Have 2 different modes

Mode 1 would dislay the garden on the monitor for checking patterns and the likes

Mode 2 would send the image over to the pico to run on the physical device

### Image deciphering and copying

## Implementation

Create a grid on which can draw, Drawing only occurs with a "pen" that can move in x/y direction. Similar to etchasketch

Can have manual control on the "pen"
